# Shrimp-Yield-Per-Recruit
Here are the R Code examples and spreadsheets available for optimizing Yield Per Recruit for shrimp fisheries in Brazil. All the necessary data to run the models is available.

The yield-per-recruit model is applied based on life history parameters. Here, we obtain all the growth, maturity, selectivity, and mortality parameters needed from the available literature. All the models reflect the average knowledge about the life history of the species in Brazil. For more details about the conceptualization and use of the data, read "Adapting for Sustainability: Understanding Shrimp Population Dynamics and Yield Optimization in Brazilian Waters".
